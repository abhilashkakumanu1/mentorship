Lets learn few things _by doing_

1. Firstly, **markdown** - its the language that i am currently using to write this notes. See the name of file _01-markdown-and-git.md_. `.md` refers to markdown.
   1. Understand what is Markdown
   2. Why am I using Markdown over simple text files?
2. Secondly, lets start with **Git**, **GitHub**. Git is a version control system & Github is a web based hosting platform for Git repositories. Oh Oh! Thats a lot of jargon in there. Lets break down each of those words and understand them better. Try to understand these at ELI5 level
   1. version control
   2. web based
   3. repository
   4. hosting platform
3. Start using Git
   1. Make an folder existing folder on your computer into git repository
   2. Stage the changes
   3. Commit the changes
   4. Make another change and commit the new changes as well. At this point you should have at least 2 commits.
   5. Learn how to see list of commits
   6. Learn how to _checkout_ to a particular commit. This is basically time travel. Really really cool feature
   7. What are branches
   8. Create a new branch, makes some changes, commit to that branch
   9. List all branches, merge a branch into another branch, delete branch
4. Once you feel confident with git, lets _push_ your local repository to GitHub.
   1. Create a empty repo in GitHub
   2. Connect your local repo with the newly created repo on GitHub
   3. Push the changes
   4. Delete the repo locally & try to pull from online repo.
   5. Play around with GitHub and other functionality it graphically provides
